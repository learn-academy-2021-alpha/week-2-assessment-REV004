## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React lifecycle methods :You can think of React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death. Every component in React goes through a lifecycle of events. I like to think of them as going through a cycle of birth, growth, and death.
- React props:Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
- event.preventDefault():The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, this can be useful when: Clicking on a "Submit" button, prevent it from submitting a form.
- DOM events: DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.
- MVC:Model–view–controller is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.
